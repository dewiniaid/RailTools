Version: 0.1.1
Date: 06. 11. 2018
  Changes:
    - Ghosts of rail signals are now treated as rail signals.
    - The distance between the selected signal and the nearest signal in each direction is now displayed.

  Bugfixes:
    - When placing signals, existing ghosts will now be treated as a signal rather than an obstruction.  This means
      that repeatedly trying to place signals from the same origin will no longer create consecutive ghosts immediately
      after each other.
    - Fix mod description in info.json
