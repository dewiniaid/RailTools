[RailTools]
train_length_too_big_error=[RailTools] Your train length is greater than the maximum search distance.  Either reduce the train length or increase the maximum search distance.
autoplace_interval_too_big_error=[RailTools] Your signal placement interval is greater than the maximum search distance.  Either reduce the interval or increase the maximum search distance.
too_many_signals_error=[RailTools] Maximum signal count of __1__ exceeded.
max_distance_error=[RailTools] Maximum search distance exceeded.

[mod-setting-name]
RailTools_max-search-distance=Maximum signal search distance (in tiles)
RailTools_max-placed-signals=Maximum amount of signals to place
RailTools_autoplace-interval=Automatic signal placement interval (in tiles)
RailTools_train-length=Train length (in tiles)


[mod-setting-description]
RailTools_max-search-distance=Approximately how far (in tiles) in each direction to search for signals.
RailTools_max-placed-signals=Maximum number of signals that can be autoplaced at one time.
RailTools_autoplace-interval=When automatically placing signals, how far apart they should be.
RailTools_train-length=How long your longest trains are, in tiles.  For vanilla Factorio, this is (engines_and_wagons * 7) - 1.  Used when creating exit blocks.


[controls]
RailTools_signal-to-end-of-line=Automatically place signals until the next junction
RailTools_place-end-of-block-signal=Create exit block


[controls-description]
RailTools_signal-to-end-of-line=Follows this rail until it reaches an existing signal, junction, intersection, or end-ofline, placing signals the entire way.
RailTools_place-end-of-block-signal=Place a signal after this one such that a train can fit between the two signals.  Will place multiple signals if the line branches.
